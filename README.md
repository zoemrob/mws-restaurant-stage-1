## How to Run this app?

In a terminal, enter `php -S localhost:8080` from the root of this repository to start a local development server.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
